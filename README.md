## 🚀 **About Univoice**
Univoice is a conceptual platform aimed at bridging the gap between students and mentors by providing:
1. **Personalized Course Recommendations**: Students can receive tailored guidance based on their academic background and goals.
2. **Mentorship Dashboard**: A space for mentors to manage sessions and offer placement advice.
